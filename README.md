# MSc Computer Science – Coding Solutions 

📚 This repository contains structured coding practice, assignments, and notes from my MSc in Computer Science program.  
The goal is to maintain consistency, improve problem-solving, and create a public academic coding journal.

## 📁 Structure

- `Semester-1/`: Includes DSA, OOP, DBMS solutions
- `Semester-2/`: OS, CN, and advanced topics
- `ML-Notes/`: Machine learning concepts with code
- `Other-Topics/`: Git, Linux, and system-level practice

## ✅ Goals

- Push 3–5 solutions per week
- Track progress over the semesters
- Use clear folder structure and filenames
- Follow clean code practices
